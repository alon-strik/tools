StarHub - Project summary
-------------------------

We had several chalanges in the StarHub Poc:

- Integration with Brocade vTm (load balancer)
- Integration with Fortinet firewall
- Integration with Vyatta router.

In addition, the environment was set on vmware VIO (openstack) without internet connectivity.

At start we create new VM that act as our "cloudify cli".

On "cloudify cli" vm I have installed the offline repository that was create by this script:
